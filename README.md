# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Description
For our project we were asked to expand further on our film query project and use our new found knowledge to create a full stack application. The application is required to have the ability to search for a film from the database using the films ID or a search keyword. When the film displays there are fields for the tables listed in our database such as title, description, category, etc... We were also given the task to create a new film, edit and existing ones information, or delete an exsisting film. The information had to be presented dynamically through a web application.
